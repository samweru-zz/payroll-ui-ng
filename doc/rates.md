## NSSF
### New Rates

The new NSSF Act came into effect on 10th January 2014. Under this act contributions to NSSF are divided into two tiers. To start with, both Tier I and Tier II contributions must be paid to the NSSF but there is a procedure for opting out of the latter.

The employee and employer each contribute 6% of pensionable pay to NSSF subject to certain limits for each tier. These limits will change each year. For the first year they are as follows:

Tier | Pensionable Pay
-----|----------------
I | Up to 6,000
II | 6,001 - 18,000

The effective date of the new NSSF rates remains uncertain due to ongoing litigation.

### Old Rates

Under the old NSSF Act, the employee and the employer contributed 5% of gross pay each. The combined employee and employer contribution for each pay period was subject to the following limits:

Pay Frequency | Maximum Contribution (Ksh)
--------------|---------------------------
Monthly | 400
Biweekly | 200
Weekly | 100
